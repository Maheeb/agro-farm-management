## About This Project

This is comparatively a big Project. It is a small agricultural farm management project.
This is made with Laravel and it is completely dynamic. There are employee sections, Product Sections, Order sections.
Admin will get notification when a new order is placed. Moreover, employees of the farm can become aware of their salary or any important notice given from the company.
I have used multi level authentication here. I have used charts to show employee performacne.
All the form fields are validated as well. Customer can buy agricultural product from this website as well as they can sell their goods as  company demands. :)
